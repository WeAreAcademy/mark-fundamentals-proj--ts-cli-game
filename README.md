You have learned [how to read and extend the code for a **TypeScript CLI game**](https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-fundamentals-proj--ts-hangman). Now, you're going to port your own over from JavaScript to TypeScript!

## Learning Outcomes

- Use variable declaration and assignment in TypeScript
- Use control flow in TypeScript
- Use functions and arguments in TypeScript
- Use search engines as a learning and knowledge aid
- Constrain variables and arguments in TypeScript
- Specify clear acceptance criteria

## Exercise 1: Setting the acceptance criteria

**Success criterion:** an `acceptance-criteria.md` file which specifies the acceptance criteria of your game

Acceptance criteria are used in software engineering to help elicit requirements and provide an easy way of confirming that requirements are met. (You can [read more about acceptance criteria in this article](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/acceptance-criteria-purposes-formats-and-best-practices).)

What are the acceptance criteria for your game to be considered a successful JavaScript port?

Create an `acceptance-criteria.md` file in the root of this directory which specifies them.

## Exercise 2: Porting your game

**Success criterion:** a JavaScript version of your CLI game which passes your acceptance criteria.

In this exercise, you should rewrite the Python version of your game in JavaScript.

It does not need to be an exact translation:

- you don't have to literally translate line-by-line or function-by-function from Python into JavaScript
- you might choose to reorganise your code or logic as you port the game over
