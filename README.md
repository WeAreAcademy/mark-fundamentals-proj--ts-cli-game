You have learned [how to read and extend the code for a **TypeScript CLI game**](https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-fundamentals-proj--ts-hangman), and [how to port a small Python CLI game over to JavaScript](https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-fundamentals-proj--js-cli-game). Now, you're going to port the same game over from JavaScript to TypeScript!

## Learning Outcomes

- Use variable declaration and assignment in TypeScript
- Use control flow in TypeScript
- Use functions and arguments in TypeScript
- Use search engines as a learning and knowledge aid
- Constrain variables and arguments in TypeScript

## Exercise: Porting your game

**Success criterion:** a TypeScript version of your CLI game which passes your acceptance criteria (as specified in your last project).

In this exercise, you should rewrite the JavaScript version of your game in TypeScript.

It does not _need_ to be an exact translation:

- you don't _have_ to literally translate line-by-line or function-by-function from JavaScript into TypeScript
- you might choose to reorganise your code or logic as you port the game over

However, please make sure that you [**enable `strict`**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict) in your TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) - e.g. like in the example provided in this repo.
